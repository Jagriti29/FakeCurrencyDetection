# Fake Currency Detection System

This project is a deep learning-based web application for detecting counterfeit Indian currency notes using ResNet50 and Streamlit. Users can upload an image of a currency note, select the denomination, and receive a real-time classification (Real or Fake) along with confidence scores. The system is designed for ease of use and can assist in quick verification of currency authenticity.
